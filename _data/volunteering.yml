  summary: >
    I lived and worked for two months in a structure devoted to helping young people, for the most part stuck in drug use, inability to integrate with society and difficulty in completing their study iter.
  highlights:
    - Discovered the joy of sharing knowledge
    - Fell in love with education and teaching
    - Crude, unforgiving experience of the limits imposed by ignorance or insufficient social care, and only secondly those deriving from poverty
    - Development of a strong personal position in relation to the subjects of intellectual honesty, importance of education and value of mutual understanding in the context of cultural diversity
