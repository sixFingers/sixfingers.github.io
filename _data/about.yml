summary: >
  Born in Pavia, Italy, i moved early and then grew up in the small, wonderful city of Mantova. In a historical context, while studying letters and humanities in the birthplace of Virgilio, i started developing a secret passion for computers. University was for me the perfect occasion to dive into coding as a self-learner. Art director by day, my nightly hacking activity took an increasingly larger piece of my time, up to the point i made it my full-time activity, passion and job. Today i keep mixing an artistic, creative mindset, a firm interest in history as a way of understanding the present, and a never-ending thirst for new technical challenges.
